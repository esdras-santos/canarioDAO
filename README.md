# Canario DAO

Canario DAO aims to be a hub for DeFi applications and to enable this to happen we use the [diamond proxy pattern](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535#diamond-interface)
which allows the addition of new functionality to the DAO. Right now Canario DAO have DEX functionalities with the options to swap between token-to-token vite-to-token and token-to-vite. The UI is not working fully but a public url to see the work that has been done until now is available and you can check that [HERE](https://esdras-santos.github.io/#/)
